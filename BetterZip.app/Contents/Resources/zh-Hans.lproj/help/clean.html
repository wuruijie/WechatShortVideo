<p>
	<i>Delete with Pattern</i> lets you remove files from the archive that match a filter pattern which you can define. For example, if you use a version control	system like Subversion, you will probably not want to include the hidden .svn folders in your archives. BetterZip uses filter patterns (simple file matching patterns using * and ? wildcards or regular expressions) to find such files and removes them with the click of a button.
 Similarly, BetterZip can filter out files while you extract from archives, e.g., the Thumbs.db files that Windows adds to folders to store thumbnails. 
</p>
<p>
	To manage your search patterns use the <i>Filtering</i> tab in the preferences window.
</p>
<p>
To delete files with a filter pattern hold down the &#x2325; key and click <em>Delete</em> in the toolbar or choose <em>Edit » Delete with Pattern</em> from the menu. You can either use regular expressions or file matching patterns. Multiple file matching patterns can be used by concatenating them with semicolons, e.g., *.o;*.log. Each file's path is matched against each pattern.
</p>
<p>
To automatically filter files while extracting or exclude files from being added to your archive you can define filter patterns for each <a href="presets.html">preset</a>.

	To learn what regular expressions are and how they work, read this <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression">Wikipedia article</a> or search <a href="http://duckduckgo.com/search?q=regular%20expressions">DuckDuckGo</a> for a vast number of tutorials.
