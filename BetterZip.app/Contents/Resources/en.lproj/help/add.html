<h2>Adding Files And Folders to an Archive</h2>	
<p>
	<img src="../../help_files/tb_add.png" align="left">
	Click the <i>Add</i> button on the toolbar or choose File > Add. An open panel will drop down in which you can
	select one or multiple files or folders to add to the archive. To add the new items to an existing folder within the archive, 
	select that folder prior to issuing the <i>Add</i> command.
</p>
<p>	
	You can also drag files and folders from the Finder into the archive window. If you drop the new items onto a folder they will
	be added to this folder. The folders are spring loaded like folders in the Finder.
