<h2>The Favorites Sidebar</h2>	
<p>
	The favorites sidebar lets you browse your favorite folders for archives. All other files are filtered out. BetterZip uses macOS' Spotlight index to quickly find and keep track of all archives inside your favorites folders.
</p>
<p>	
	To open an archive from the favorites sidebar simply select the archive. It will open in the same window. If you already have an archive with changes opened, you will be asked to save your changes first. 
</p>
<p>	
	To open the favorites sidebar choose View > Favorites, click the favorites button <img src="../../help_files/collapse-right.png" style="display: inline; padding: 0; margin: 0 0 -3px 0;"> in the window's bottom-left corner or press &#x2318;B on your keyboard.
</p>
<p>
	To add folders to the favorites sidebar drag them from the Finder into the sidebar or click the + button below the archives list.
</p>
<p>
	To remove a folder from the favorites sidebar select it and click the - button below the archives list.
</p>
<p>
	To filter the archives in the favorites list, enter any part of the name you are looking for into the search field below the favorites list. The files and folders in the list will be filtered and only matches will be displayed. To cancel the search and display all files and folders again, click the small x-button in the search field. It works similarly to the search field in iTunes or other applications. The keyboard shortcut to enter this search field is &#x2318;&#x2325;F.
