<h2>Test the Integrity of an Archive</h2>	
<p>
	Open an archive and choose <em>File > Test</em>, click the <em>Test</em> button in the toolbar or press &#x21A9;T on your keyboard. BetterZip will test the integrity of the archive. If any errors are found, BetterZip will put the details in the <a href="transcript.html">transcript</a> window and display an error message.
</p>
<p>
	To test archives using the operations queue drop them on the "Test" drop area of the Drop Bar. 
</p>
<p>
	With the rar tool installed, BetterZip can recreate lost volumes, if recovery volumes are available and repair damaged archives, if the archive was built with enough recovery records. BetterZip will offer to repair archives automatically when errors are found during testing.
