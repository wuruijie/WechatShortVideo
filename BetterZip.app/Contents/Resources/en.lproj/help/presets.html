<h2>Presets</h2>	
<p>
	Presets collect all settings that can be applied to an archive, from the destination folder and archive format, to passwords and even a script to execute after the operation completed. There are two types: <i>save presets</i> for archive creation and <i>extraction presets</i>.
</p>
<p>	
	You can configure presets in the preferences window on the Presets tab. The Presets tab has itself two tabs, one for each type: Extract and Save. Both share the same structure: On the left side they each have a list of all the presets of the selected kind. Each preset has two radio buttons in the list. The one in the Q (for queue) column selects the preset to be used when extracting/saving through the BetterZip service and all other queue operations. The T (for toolbar) column selects the preset to use when clicking the toolbar button. Below the list are the usual buttons for adding and deleting presets. Another button has a drop-down menu with commands for duplicating the selected preset and re-adding the factory presets, in case you deleted them.
</p>
<p>
	On the right side of the list is an area with all the options you can set for the preset:
	<ul>
		<li>The preset's name. This will be displayed in the menu. </li>
		<li>The destination folder where the archive or the extracted files will be stored. Drop down the button's menu to choose a different folder or have BetterZip display a save panel when saving or extracting with this preset. There is also a setting <i>Next to original</i> which will save the archive or extracted files next to the original files respectively the archive.</li>
